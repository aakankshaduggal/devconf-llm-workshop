# Exercises

Here are some exercises you can now try and explore by yourself!


1. **Try uploading other types of documentation** - Upload other documentation and try asking questions specific to its content to see if the model was able to generate answers from it
2. **Experimenting with input prompts** - Try different types of prompt that you provide as an input to the LLM
3. **Try different vector databases** - We have used the Chromadb in this workshop, but you can try other vector databases such as Milvus
4. **Try different embedding models** - In this workshop, we are using the `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` embedding model, but you can experiment with other models and update it [here](https://github.com/containers/ai-lab-recipes/blob/main/recipes/natural_language_processing/rag/app/rag_app.py#L17C48-L17C69)
5. **Try different LLM** - In this workshop, we are using the `granite-7b-lab` model: [https://huggingface.co/instructlab/granite-7b-lab-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/instructlab/granite-7b-lab-GGUF), but you can try other smaller models from HuggingFace instead such as `mistral-7b-instruct`: [https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF) or any other model of your choice.
